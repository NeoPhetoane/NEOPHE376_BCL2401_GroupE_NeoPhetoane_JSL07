**Overview**

This project is a certificate generator. A user is required to enter their details, once they are completely filled, they click submit and the modal certificate appears.

**Reflections**

**Areas of Mastery**

Retrieving elements: I can efficiently retrieve elements by their IDs and manipulate them as needed within functions.

Handling click events: The click event handler is responsible for controlling the visibility of the modal.

Event listeners: I am capable of attaching an event listener to respond to specific user interactions. In this case, the event listener checks if the form fields are filled out correctly, preventing form submission if any required fields are left empty.

**Challenges Faced**
While this project was relatively straightforward, ensuring proper management of the modal's visibility proved challenging. Making sure the modal was initially hidden and only displayed after form submission required careful handling of the display property.

**Areas for Improvement**
Responsive design: I would include media queries to ensure the design remains responsive and consistent across various devices and screen resolutions.

Enhanced CSS styling: Improving the visual appearance of the form by adding more CSS styling would make it more appealing and user-friendly. Additionally, implementing a custom cursor when hovering over the "X" to close the certificate modal would improve the user experience.

**Overall Learning Experience**

This certificate generator project enhanced my web development skills, particularly in JavaScript event handling, DOM manipulation, and CSS styling. Managing the modal's visibility improved my problem-solving abilities. For future projects, I'll focus on responsive designs and visual improvements.
